		`I am a self-taught developer who loves developing products that
  solve real-world problems, starting from their initial ideation, research,
  and design process, to the development. I love the art of creating things,
  from drawing, painting, and other things that involve craftsmanship, which is
  what drove me into learning about programming in early 2022. The way software
  development requires collaborative efforts and combined knowledge from vast
  fields in order to deliver a product to the user drew me into this field,
  where I can put my love of the art of creation into developing something
  practical.`,
		`My current process in software development is to take an idea and then
  research the "hows" and "whys" the product exists and find the best way to
  bring the vision to life. While I mainly focus on the programming side of the
  equation, I love all the things that comprise the software development
  process, from branding, UI/UX, and project management. I love learning new
  things in my journey as a developer. In fact, I learnt about branding and
  UI/UX to bring my personality to life through this portfolio site, because I
  believe a good user experience requires not just performance but also how the
  product looks and what kind of story it evokes.`,
		`On the technical side, my philosophy is to build a system that is
  maintainable, performant, and well-tested. I think it’s crucial for me as a
  developer to not just cater for the user side of the equation but also to
  create a good developer experience, by writing clean code that is easy to
  understand and developing a testing strategy to ease future refactors and
  feature updates.`,
		`There are so many things I still need to learn in this journey of becoming a
  better developer. While the learning never stops, I am intrigued by the many
  possibilities that this field can bring to help people solve and ease their
  daily activities. Currently, I am delving more into real-time communication
  systems and security.`,
